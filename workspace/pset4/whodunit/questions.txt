1.  TODO operations on BMP related data types based on microsofts manual
2.  TODO simplify the data types like byte(8) word(16) dword(32) long(32) and determine whether they are signed or unsigned

3.  TODO byte = 1B
         dword = 4B
         long = 4B
         word = 2B

4.  TODO ASCII values are Character "B" and "M" and in hexadecimal its values are "0x42" and "0x4D"
5.  TODO
         bfSize tells us the size of Bitmap file where
         biSize tells us the size of Structure.
6.  TODO
          biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
7.  TODO biBitCount
8.  TODO 1.if intptr could not perform the read operation on the file
         2.if the outptr in unable toperform write operation on file
9.  TODO
         it requires the quantity value to read as we read only struct we keep it 1
10. TODO
         3bytes of padding is needed
11. TODO
         it is a file position indicator
12. TODO
         is is used with fseek to find the current location
